Questions:

- should a user be able to delete their own post if it's locked
- can moderators delete posts that arent theirs, or just lock posts?


======================
Todos:

- add replies
- delete comments -- should only work with own comments
- posts and comments should be ordered by rating
- subreddits ordered alphabetically
